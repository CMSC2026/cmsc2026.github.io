Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts on topics related to the scope of the conference (see below). All papers will be double-blind peer-reviewed by Programme Committee members.

There are three submission categories for the conference:
- **Full Papers**, divided into two subcategories (10 to 12 pages):
	- Best practice papers/country reports/experience reports
	- Research papers (e.g., empirical, qualitative, quantitative, theory building, research methods, comparative studies, transferability of methods and results from other disciplines)
- **Short Papers**, divided into two subcategories (5 to 6 pages):
	- Position/discussion papers
	- Work in progress
- **Poster proposals** (2-4 pages)

The page limitations include references. Full and short papers may have an appendix, whose length must not exceed 3 pages.

Accepted papers (full or short) will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The submissions should be formatted accordingly. Posters will not be published.

## Conference Scope

The main topics of the conference include (but are not limited to):
- Teaching Computer Science in early-childhood, primary, secondary, and higher education
- CS Unplugged
- Computational Thinking / Algorithmic Thinking
- Broadening engagement and diversity for the exact sciences
- Teacher education in Mathematics and Computer Science 
- Teaching CS in relation with other subjects, 
- Contests and competitions
- Education for students with special needs
- Linking mathematical and computational content for fundamental competency development 
- Education within resource-limited environments
- Remote learning amidst the effects of conflict - Teaching for Ukrainian refugees inside and outside the nation.

Work submitted to CMSC should be novel and material that has been previously published should not be republished unless the work has been significantly revised. Note, however, that while novel work is highly valued, constructive replication of previous studies can also be a significant contribution, and a new interpretation or evaluation of previously published work can make a good contribution.

## Submission Guidelines

All contributions (papers and posters) will be submitted through the XXX platform.

### Full and Short Paper Requirements

Submissions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style guidelines using LaTeX. The maximum length of the paper (including references, but excluding the optional appendix) is 12 pages. The length of the abstract should be 200-300 words.

To prepare a poster (2-4 pages), authors are also asked to use the same Springer templates.

As the short and full papers will be **double-blind peer-reviewed**, the authors should leave their names and affiliations blank in the initial submission, and take care to avoid details in the article that could be used to identify the authors. These include institution information, specific funding information and clear self-citations.

### Poster Requirements

The purpose of the poster is to stimulate discussion with conference participants during the conference about your presented activity. During the poster session, the poster presenters should be present at their booth to give short presentations to interested participants.

Size and orientation: A1 portrait (594 Ã— 841 mm)
Minimum information required: title, author(s), institution(s), contact information, problem statement, description of work, gained results, future work, main references.

Please bring a printed poster of the correct size to the conference.
