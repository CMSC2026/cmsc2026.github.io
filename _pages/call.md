Authors are invited to submit manuscripts on topics related to the conference's scope (see below). All manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by members of the Programme Committee.

More precisely, CMSC welcomes the following contributions: 

- **Standard papers** from 3 to 12 pages; the papers should be in one of the following categories:
	- Research papers (e.g., empirical, qualitative, quantitative, theory building, research methods, comparative studies, transferability of methods and results from other disciplines)
	- Best practice papers/country reports/experience reports
	- Description of creative products, for instance, dance or song performance
	- Position/discussion papers


- **Poster proposals** up to 3 pages for:
	- work in progress
	- short description of published work

The page limitations include references. Papers may have an appendix, whose length must not exceed 3 pages; reading of the appendix is at the discretion of the reviewers. Accepted papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The submissions should be formatted accordingly. Posters will not be published.

Work submitted to CMSC as standard papers should be novel and original. Material that has been previously published can be presented as a poster, or it can be submitted as a standard paper only if the work has been significantly revised. Note, however, that while novel work is highly valued, constructive replication of previous studies can also be a significant contribution, and a new interpretation or evaluation of previously published work can make a good contribution.

All inquiries about submissions should be sent to [cmsc2026@dei.unipd.it](mailto:cmsc2026@dei.unipd.it).

## Conference Scope
The main topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:
- Teaching Computer Science in early childhood, primary, secondary, and higher education
- CS Unplugged
- Computational Thinking / Algorithmic Thinking
- Broadening engagement and diversity for the exact sciences
- Teacher education in Mathematics and Computer Science 
- Teaching CS in relation to other subjects
- Linking mathematical and computational content for fundamental competency development 
- Contests and competitions
- Education for students with special needs
- Education within resource-limited environments
- Education in conflict-affected areas

## Accepted Contributions
For all accepted contributions, we expect at least one author to attend the conference to present it. 
Given the creative nature of CMSC, you will have a free choice of how to present your work, as long as it fits the
schedule and conference locations. We encourage authors to contact the organizers before the submission for inquiries about special requirements of the presentation.
Possible formats include, but are not limited to:
- a traditional plenary conference talk
- a video showing a live performance
- an installation of limited size
- a test session for an educational activity (with other participants as test subjects)

## Submission Guidelines
All contributions (papers and posters) must be submitted through the Microsoft CMT platform, using LNCS templates. More details will be posted soon.

### Standard Paper Requirements
Submissions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style guidelines using LaTeX. The maximum length of the paper (including references, but excluding the optional appendix) is 12 pages; the minimum length is 3 pages.

### Poster Requirements
To prepare a poster submission (up to 3 pages), authors are also asked to use the same Springer templates. The purpose of the poster is to stimulate discussion with conference participants about your presented activity during the conference. During the poster session, the poster presenters should be present at their booth to give short presentations to interested participants.
The final poster of an accepted poster submission should have the following requirements:
- Size and orientation: A1 portrait (594 × 841 mm)
- Minimum information required: title, author(s), institution(s), contact information, problem statement, description of work, gained results, future work, and primary references.
Please bring a printed poster of the correct size to the conference.

### Submission Platform
The Microsoft CMT service was used to manage the peer-review process for this conference. This service was provided free of charge by Microsoft, which covered all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services, as well as software development and support.
