There will be several events at CMSC! Here a first list of events (more to come!)

- Presentations of accepted papers
- Poster session for accepted posters
- Social events (TBC): tour of "Palazzo Bo", which is the historical main building of the University of Padova; tour of the historical city center of Padova; social dinner.
- Keynotes from international invited speakers
- Special event:
  - **Generative AI and co-creativity in music** by prof. Sergio Canazza (University of Padova, "Centro di Sonologia Computazione").
  -  Generative AI and co-creativity in music: we will discuss to what extent modern generative artificial intelligence is "creative" in music field. To this end, we will bring together a small group of 3 experts from the hard sciences (computer science/engineering) and humanities (philosophy, musicology). Can machines compose? How does musical writing change when a composer works side by side with an AI? At the Centro di Sonologia Computazione (CSC: http://csc.dei.unipd.it) of the Department of Information Engineering (Padua University), a study was conducted with the aim of examining the interaction between the composer and generative AI. The experiment took place in three steps: the composition of the dataset, the artificial generation of the pieces, and finally, their reworking by the composer Ardavan Vossoughi. The instrument chosen as the recipient and performer of the music was the Disklavier, an acoustic piano equipped with actuators that allow remote control of keys and pedals. During the event we can discuss with the composer - from different points of view - and listen the music co-create together an AI.
- **Teachers' Day (October 15th, 2026)**. The last day of the conference will be dedicated a mutual contamination between researchers and teachers. The program is under development but we plan:
  - A presentation of the local Montessori primary school on teaching math and computational thinking with the Montessori approach.
  - For a selected number of accepted papers, it would be given the opportunity to present their activities to teachers.
