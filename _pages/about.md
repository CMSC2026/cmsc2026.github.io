We are pleased to invite you to the 5th edition of the international conference **Creative Mathematical Sciences Communication**.

The CMSC conference series was initiated in 2013, recognizing that the competencies required for the increasingly computerized world are essentially mathematical. The CMSC aims to explore new ways of communicating the rich mathematical ideas fundamental for computer science.  The science of computer science is mathematics.  “*Turn off the machines and turn on your mathematical thinking.*” For an example, see “Games That Cannot Go on Forever! Active Participation in Research Is the Main Issue for Kids” by Michael R. Fellows, Frances A. Rosamond. CMSC 2024 Proceedings, Trier, Germany.
 
There's a need and an appetite by mathematicians and computer scientists for outreach and engagement at all levels. Bringing together researchers, educators and communicators, the conference hopes to explore new ways of mathematical-computational thinking and lay the groundwork for innovative teaching and research engagement approaches and methods at all education levels. 
 
The organizers of CMSC believe that engaging in mathematical science goes in two directions. Certain areas of research, such as algorithms and combinatorics, are accessible even to elementary-age children, while conversely, interaction with non-specialists, including young learners, can spark new research questions.  Creating opportunities for broad and inclusive engagement in the mathematical sciences not only enriches the researchers but also brings lasting benefits to society as a whole.
