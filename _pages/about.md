We are pleased to invite you to the 8th edition of the international conference **Creative Mathematical Sciences Communication**, which will be held in Padova, Italy, from October 12 to October 15, 2026.

The CMSC conference series was initiated in 2013, recognizing that the competencies required for the increasingly computerized world are essentially mathematical. The CMSC aims to explore new ways of communicating the rich mathematical ideas fundamental for computer science.  The science of computer science is mathematics.  “*Turn off the machines and turn on your mathematical thinking.*” For an example, see “Games That Cannot Go on Forever! Active Participation in Research Is the Main Issue for Kids” by Michael R. Fellows, Frances A. Rosamond. CMSC 2024 Proceedings, Trier, Germany.
 
There's a need and an appetite by mathematicians and computer scientists for outreach and engagement at all levels. Bringing together researchers, educators and communicators, the conference hopes to explore new ways of mathematical-computational thinking and lay the groundwork for innovative teaching and research engagement approaches and methods at all education levels. 
 
The organizers of CMSC believe that engaging in mathematical science goes in two directions. Certain areas of research, such as algorithms and combinatorics, are accessible even to elementary-age children, while conversely, interaction with non-specialists, including young learners, can spark new research questions.  Creating opportunities for broad and inclusive engagement in the mathematical sciences not only enriches the researchers but also brings lasting benefits to society as a whole.

## About CMSC

Kids of all ages and modern citizens need to appreciate algorithms and computational thinking. Join scientists, researchers, teachers and artists in developing new ways of communicating computational thinking, including computing activities across the curriculum, at every level. CMSC welcomes contributions in forms such as story, dance, art, theatre,  … many ways to communicate science to the public.
CMSC aims to create activities to teach kids without computers, following the [Computer Science Unplugged](www.csunplugged.org) philosophy.

The design and analysis of algorithms, modeling, clever information representation, all have the potential to unlock a great amount of creativity. Bring your ideas, your experimental attempts. The atmosphere is casual with a focus on brainstorming.
CMSC aims to encourage researchers to provide open problems from their area that are accessible to authentic engagement by kids, and to explore ways of mentoring their work. Let’s attract children to open problems, to dare reach for gold. We also seek new ways to show the open, unsolved problems that researchers are pursuing.

We celebrate when outreach results in greater progress in science. Outreach can be a two-way street. Let us know the benefits to your scientific research or teaching.
